In this individual project, you will enhance the medium-sized Employee Management
System (EMS) application developed in Assessment 2 by implementing both a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Text-Based Interface (TBI), allowing users to
choose their preferred mode of interaction. This GUI should provide an intuitive and
user-friendly way for users to interact with the system while retaining the functionality
of the text-based interface.
Additionally, the application must incorporate sorting and searching algorithms to
manage and retrieve data efficiently. You are required to apply appropriate testing
techniques to validate the functionality, efficiency, and performance of the application.
A detailed report must be submitted, outlining your design choices, testing approach,
encountered challenges, and solutions implemented. This assessment contributes to
learning outcomes a, b, c and d.
On successful completion of this individual project, you should have demonstrated that
you are able to:
• Extend your group project application (medium-sized Employee Management
System (EMS) for a company that allows the company admin to manage
employees, their personal details, their monthly performance, and their monthly
salary details) by introducing a GUI based interface
• Allow users to choose their preferred mode of interaction – GUI or text based
• GUI should provide an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to interact with
the system while retaining the functionality of the text-based interface
• Demonstrate effective integration of GUI components with the application's
underlying logic
• Ensure that the application handles user input and file operations effectively in
both interface modes
• Provide meaningful feedback to users through appropriate dialogs and
messages in the GUI
• Incorporate sorting and searching algorithms in your application to manage and
retrieve data efficiently
• Provide an insightful discussion on algorithm complexity, suggesting
improvements
Overall, the GUI interface must give option to the user for all operations such as add,
delete, query and add search / sort features.
You need to submit your work on Moodle.
Please remember to submit a single PDF report only, having a cover page, and a table
of content. Please use figure captions and numbers. Please use references.
In general, for the report, you should use code/ output snippets along with meaningful
captions and figure numbers to demonstrate your work in the report.
The report should include:
• Project Overview (System description, objectives, key features)
• User Interface Implementation (Details on GUI and text-based interface
design)
• System Architecture (Class diagrams, design patterns used)
• Sorting & Searching Implementation (Algorithms applied and their
justification)
• Thorough and insightful discussion on algorithm complexity and how to
improve it
• Testing & Debugging (Test cases, expected vs. actual results, debugging
logs)
• Reflection (Challenges faced, problem-solving approach, and lessons
learned)
• All source code - Well-structured Java program with appropriate comments
and documentation should be provided as appendix
• A link to all source files separately (a link to a cloud storage where the source
code (working project with all necessary files) is located).
